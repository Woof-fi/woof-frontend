# Woof - Let's Build This Together 🐶

**For:** [Developer Name]
**From:** Tommi
**Date:** February 2026

---

## TL;DR - The Ask

I'm ready to go all-in on Woof. I want you as my co-founder and CTO.

**What I'm proposing:**
- **50/50 equity split** (4-year vesting, 1-year cliff)
- **Side hustle initially** (20+ hrs/week each)
- **You choose the tech stack** (I trust your judgment completely)
- **3-month timeline to MVP**
- **€30K-€75K funding path** (Business Finland NIY grant - already researched)
- **Start now** (company formation this week)

---

## Why Now?

### The Opportunity is Real

**Market validation:**
- No dominant player in this space (koirapuisto is tiny)
- Dog owners I've talked to love the concept
- Pet tech is growing (€40B+ market in Europe)
- We can be first-movers in Nordics

**Our advantage:**
- Your development expertise (best I've worked with in 15 years)
- My product/PM skills (7+ years leading products at Oikotie)
- We meet daily - no communication overhead
- Strong friendship = trust and alignment

**Timing:**
- I'm serious (not just another idea - I've done the research)
- I can invest €5K-€15K bootstrap capital
- I'm considering 4-day work week at Oikotie for this
- Funding path is clear (NIY grant = free money)

---

## What We're Building

### MVP Scope (3 Months)

**Core features:**
1. **Social Network for Dogs**
   - Dog profiles (not human profiles)
   - Feed with posts, likes, comments
   - Dog friends (add, accept, connect)

2. **Health Diary**
   - Track vet visits, vaccinations, medications
   - Reminders (never miss a vaccination)
   - Export reports for vet visits

3. **Dog Park Meetups**
   - Find dog parks (OpenStreetMap)
   - Schedule playdates
   - See who's going to the park

**Explicitly NOT in MVP:**
- ❌ Marketplace/store (too complex)
- ❌ Messaging (just comments for now)
- ❌ Advanced maps/GPS tracking

**Working prototype:** I have a static HTML/CSS/JS prototype that shows the UX - you can see it in `/src/`

---

## Tech Stack - Your Call

I've done research, but **you're the CTO - you decide**.

### My Recommendations (Feel Free to Override):

**Mobile:**
- React Native + Expo (single codebase, iOS + Android)
- OR Angular (you're the expert - if you prefer, let's do it)
- OR whatever you think is best

**Backend:**
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- OR whatever you're most productive in

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (structured data for health records)

**Cloud:**
- AWS (startup credits, ecosystem)
- AWS Cognito (Google/Apple login)
- S3 for photos

**Maps:**
- OpenStreetMap (free, global)

**Bottom line:** With AI assistance, we can use any stack efficiently. I trust your judgment on what's best.

## The Business Plan

### Monetization (Realistic Path)

**Phase 1 (Year 1):** Free with contextual ads
- Native advertising from vets, pet shops, dog food brands
- Build user base first (10K+ users)

**Phase 2 (Year 2):** Freemium
- Premium features (€2.99/month)
- Vet clinic accounts (€49/month)

**Phase 3 (Year 2-3):** Exit
- Sell to Mars Petcare, Nestlé Purina, Petco, or similar
- Exit before we need complex monetization

### Funding Strategy

**Month 1-3 (Bootstrap):**
- I invest €5K-€15K for servers, domain, tools
- No salaries (equity only)
- Keep our day jobs, work evenings/weekends

**Month 2-3 (Apply for NIY):**
- Business Finland NIY grant: €30K-€75K
- **It's a GRANT (not a loan!) - no repayment, zero equity taken**
- ~30-40% approval rate
- We have a strong case (team, prototype, market opportunity)

**Month 5-6 (If NIY Approved):**
- Use funding for salaries, marketing, growth
- You can go full-time if you want
- Or keep as side hustle and bank the money

**Month 9-12 (If Needed):**
- Angel investors (I have network from Oikotie)
- €100K-€200K round

---

## Equity & Ownership

### Proposed Split: 50/50

**Why 50/50:**
- We're both equally critical (no product without you, no direction without me)
- Standard for co-founder teams
- Keeps it simple and fair
- We're best friends - no need to nickel and dime

**Vesting:**
- 4-year vesting schedule
- 1-year cliff (if someone leaves early, they get nothing)
- Standard protection for both of us

**Bootstrap costs:**
- I'll fund initial costs (€5K-€15K) from my savings
- You contribute sweat equity (coding)
- Still 50/50 equity (keeps it simple)

**If you prefer different split, let's discuss!**

## Timeline - 3 Months to MVP

- **Week 1-2:** Infrastructure setup
  - AWS account, GitHub repos, database
  - Auth implementation (Cognito)

## What I'm Committing

**Time:**
- 20+ hours/week (considering 4-day work week at Oikotie)
- More if needed for critical tasks

**Money:**
- €5K-€15K for bootstrap costs
- More if needed (I have strong savings)

**Responsibilities:**
- Product strategy and roadmap
- UI/UX design (Figma)
- User research and validation
- Company formation and legal
- Fundraising (NIY application, later angels/VCs)
- Marketing and beta launch
- User stories and specs for you

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- Coding (that's your domain)
- Technical architecture decisions (you decide)

---

## What I Need From You

**Commitment:**
- 20+ hours/week for next 3 months
- Keep this as side hustle (don't quit your consultancy yet)
- Full-time only after funding or strong traction

**Technical Leadership:**
- Choose tech stack (you're the expert)
- Build the MVP (backend + mobile)
- Infrastructure and deployment
- Technical decisions

**Realistic Assessment:**
- Is 3 months to MVP realistic? (I think yes, but you know better)
- Any concerns about the tech scope?
- What do you need from me to make this work?

---

## Risks & Reality Check

### Biggest Risks:

**Risk 1: We don't get users**
- Mitigation: Start with friends/dog owners, iterate based on feedback
- Exit plan: If no traction after 6-12 months, we cut losses

**Risk 2: NIY gets rejected**
- Mitigation: Keep building with bootstrap, apply for angels or reapply NIY
- I can sustain longer without salary

**Risk 3: One of us can't commit time**
- Mitigation: Vesting protects both of us (1-year cliff)
- We're honest with each other about bandwidth

**Risk 4: We realize it's not working**
- Reality: We only quit if BOTH agree there's no future
- No hard feelings - we're friends first

### What Could Go Wrong:

**I'm being realistic:**
- This is hard (most startups fail)
- We might not get funding
- Users might not care
- It might take longer than 3 months

**But I believe:**
- We're the right team
- The market opportunity exists
- We can execute better than anyone else
- Even if we fail, we'll learn a ton

## Questions to Discuss

Before you commit, let's align on:

1. **Equity:** 50/50 good with you? Or prefer different?
2. **Timeline:** Is 3 months realistic? What would you change?
3. **Tech stack:** What do you want to use?
4. **Time commitment:** Can you do 20+ hrs/week for 3 months?
5. **Concerns:** What am I missing? What worries you?
6. **When can you start:** Immediately? 2 weeks? 1 month?
