# Woof - Dog-Centric Social Network

## Project Overview
Woof (aka Petbook/Dogbook) is a **dog-centric social network and local discovery platform** where dogs are the main users, not humans. It combines social networking, location-based discovery, and pet marketplace.

## Vision
A platform where:
- **Dogs have profiles**, not just owners
- Social interactions happen between dogs (and their owners)
- Local discovery is based on **territories** (parks, neighborhoods)
- Marketplace is focused on pet products and services

## Current State: Startup Mode 🚀

**Status:** Ready to execute - developer committed, needs execution plan and funding strategy

**Team:**
- **Tommi Kivisaari** - Co-founder, CEO/CPO
  - Lead PM at Oikotie Asunnot (PM since 2016)
  - 15+ years in top Finnish IT companies
  - Product vision, strategy, fundraising, user research
  - Can dedicate 20+ hours/week (considering 4-day work week at Oikotie)
  - Strong financial runway (years without salary if needed, significant savings)
  - Dog owner (understands user needs firsthand)
  - Boss at Oikotie from VC world (potential advisor later, not disclosed yet)

- **Developer** (name private) - Co-founder, CTO
  - Best developer Tommi worked with in 15 years across top Finnish IT companies
  - Former team lead (led by being better than everyone) and CTO
  - Currently senior consultant at elite consultancy (only top-tier talent)
  - Working on AI projects for major bank currently
  - Expert in Angular, versatile across full tech stack
  - AI-assisted development capabilities
  - Loves the idea, sees market potential, ready to build
  - Can dedicate 20+ hours/week as side hustle initially
  - Close friend of Tommi (meet almost daily, lunch 2x/week)
  - Waiting for: proper project plan + funding strategy to start

**Relationship:** High trust, daily communication, strong friendship

**Current Approach:**
- Side hustle initially (both 20+ hrs/week)
- Bootstrap with equity only (no salaries initially)
- Use funding for growth when secured
- Developer full-time only after funding or significant traction

## MVP Strategy (Phase 1)

**Core Focus:** Hybrid - Social Network + Health Diary + Dog Park Meetups

**Multi-value proposition:**
- Social features (posts, dog friends, engagement) = fun and addictive
- Health diary (vet visits, vaccinations, medications) = practical value
- Dog park meetups (schedule playdates, find parks) = real-world connection

**Open Question - MUST DECIDE:**
What is the PRIMARY core feature?
- Option A: Social feed (Instagram for dogs)
- Option B: Health diary (practical tracking tool)
- Option C: Dog park meetups (local connection)
- Option D: All three equally important

**Decision needed:** Test with early users to see what sticks

**MVP Features (Must-Have):**
- ✅ User authentication (Google, Apple login)
- ✅ Dog profiles (public + private)
- ✅ Social feed (posts, likes, comments)
- ✅ Dog friends (add, accept, list)
- ✅ Health diary (vet visits, vaccinations, medications, weight)
- ✅ Reminders (vaccination, medication)
- ✅ Dog park discovery (using OpenStreetMap)
- ✅ Meetup coordination (schedule playdates at parks)

**Explicitly OUT of MVP:**
- ❌ Marketplace/store (too complex, add later)
- ❌ Territory system (simplify to just parks)
- ❌ Direct messaging (comments on posts only)
- ❌ Advanced maps/GPS features

**Monetization Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Free with contextual ads
  - Native advertising from vets, dog food brands, pet shops
  - Ads MUST be contextual and non-intrusive (Tommi dislikes bad ads)
- **Phase 2:** Premium features (after user base established)
- **Phase 3:** Veterinarian accounts and B2B

**Exit Strategy:**
- Build beloved service with strong user base
- Exit to major pet company (Mars Petcare, Nestlé Purina, Petco, etc.)
- Prefer exit before needing complex monetization
- Open to long-haul if trajectory excellent

## Tech Stack

### Current (Prototype)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (single global stylesheet)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Font Awesome icons

### Production Stack (Recommended, but Developer decides)

**Mobile/Frontend:**
- React Native + Expo (mobile-first, iOS + Android from one codebase)
- OR Angular (developer is expert, knows it inside-out)
- OR other framework developer prefers
- **Final decision:** Developer's call - he's the expert

**Backend:**
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express (JavaScript everywhere)
- OR developer's preference
- RESTful API

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (structured data for health records, relationships)

**Cloud:**
- AWS (recommended for startup ecosystem and credits)
- AWS Cognito for auth (Google, Apple, email login)
- S3 for photo storage
- RDS for database

**Maps:**
- OpenStreetMap (free, scalable globally)
- NOT Google Maps (expensive, licensing)

**Key Principle:**
- With AI, can use any language/framework efficiently
- Developer decides based on his expertise and preferences
- Tommi trusts developer's technical judgment completely

## Market & Competition

**Initial Market:**
- Finland (possibly start Helsinki only for focus)
- Should be scalable to Nordics, then Europe, then global
- Finnish + English language support

**Competition:**
- Very little established competition
- In Finland: "koirapuisto" app (small)
- Some dog park finder apps exist but haven't picked up
- No established market leader
- **This is an opportunity - no dominant player yet**

**Validation:**
- Tommi has talked to dog/pet owners - they love the idea
- Positive feedback on concept
- Ready for more validation when needed

## Business Model

**Phase 1: Free with Ads**
- Only realistic initial path
- Build user base first
- Contextual, native advertising
- Ad partners: vets, dog food brands, pet shops, groomers
- Must be non-intrusive and contextual (not annoying)

**Phase 2: Premium (when established)**
- Freemium model
- Premium features for power users
- Vet/clinic accounts

**Phase 3: Exit**
- Sell to major pet company
- Mars Petcare, Nestlé Purina, Petco, Chewy, etc.
- Before needing heavy monetization complexity

## Funding & Financials

**Bootstrap Phase (Now - Month 3):**
- Own investment: €100-€5,000 for initial costs
- No salaries (equity only)
- Server costs, domain, AWS, tools
- Tommi can fund easily from savings
- Question: Should costs be split 50/50 or Tommi funds?

**Funding Strategy:**
- **NIY Grant** (Business Finland): €30K-€75K (50-75% grant, no equity taken!)
- Timeline: Apply Month 2-3, receive Month 5-6
- Use for: Salaries when needed, marketing, growth
- Alternative: Angels from Tommi's network if NIY rejected

**Financial Runway:**
- Tommi: Can go years without salary (strong savings/investments)
- Developer: Can sustain as side hustle, needs salary for full-time

**Company Formation:**
- Name: Woof Oy (if available)
- Cost: ~€330 to register
- Needed for NIY application

## Design Principles
1. **Dog-first identity** - Dogs are the primary users, not humans
2. **Territory-based** - Local discovery is core to the experience
3. **Mobile parity** - Mobile UX is as important as desktop
4. **Real-world connections** - Focus on actual meetups and places
5. **Community-driven** - Social features enable dog owner communities

## Next Steps / Roadmap
See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for detailed next steps.

**High-level priorities:**
1. Choose backend stack and architecture
2. Implement authentication system
3. Build API and database
4. Add real-time features (messaging, notifications)
5. Implement marketplace backend
6. Content moderation and safety

## Working with This Project

When helping with Woof:
- **Preserve the UI foundation** - The frontend is solid, don't rebuild unnecessarily
- **Think dog-first** - Features should make sense from a dog's perspective
- **Consider territory logic** - Location is a first-class concept
- **Mobile matters** - Always consider mobile UX
- **Keep it fun** - This is a personal project, not work. Be creative!

## Equity & Ownership

**Open Questions (Need to Decide):**
1. **Equity split:**
   - Option A: 50/50 (Tommi + Developer)
   - Option B: 60/40 (Tommi gets more for the idea)
   - Option C: 40/30/30 (Tommi/Developer/Wife as UX designer)

2. **Considerations:**
   - Tommi came up with the idea
   - Developer does most technical work initially
   - If Tommi funds more, should he get more equity?
   - If costs split 50/50, then 50/50 equity?
   - Tommi's wife: Former UX designer, but out of game for years

3. **Standard practice needed:** What's typical for co-founder equity splits?

**Decision criteria:**
- Fair split based on contribution (idea, execution, funding)
- Keep it simple and aligned
- Don't overthink it

## Domain & Branding

**Domain Search:**
- woof.fi (TAKEN - Tommi bid €50, unlikely to get)
- Need alternatives (ask Claude for suggestions)

**Company Name:**
- Woof Oy (if available)

**Design:**
- Fun and playful
- NOT overly tacky
- Clean and approachable

## Privacy & Stealth Mode

**Current Status:**
- Not telling Oikotie yet (Tommi still works there)
- Some concern about revealing too much publicly
- Boss at Oikotie from VC world (could be advisor later)
- Want to be somewhat discreet in early validation

**Approach:**
- Informal validation with dog owners (not formal interviews yet)
- Keep service concept somewhat private until launch
- Can do casual user research without revealing everything

## Context Notes
- This is a **personal side project** (not Oikotie work)
- Tommi: Lead PM at Oikotie, but Woof is separate
- Started as exploration with ChatGPT, now ready for serious build
- Both treating as side hustle initially (20+ hrs/week each)
- Will go full-time only after funding or strong traction
- Developer won't back out until working service built
- Would only quit together if no traction/future
