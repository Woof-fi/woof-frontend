## 🎯 This Week - Critical Path

### Priority 1: Developer Meeting (Day 1-2)

**During the meeting:**

**Your talking points:**
1. "I'm serious about this - here's what I've prepared" (show docs)
2. "I want you as co-founder, 50/50 equity"
3. "You choose the tech stack - I trust you completely"
4. "3 months to MVP, side hustle initially"
5. "€30K-€75K funding path (NIY grant - it's free money!)"
6. "What do you think? What concerns do you have?"

**Questions to ask HIM:**
- [ ] Can you commit 20+ hrs/week for 3 months?
- [ ] Is 3-month MVP timeline realistic?

## 💬 Conversation Starters with Developer

### When you need to discuss something:

**Product priority:**
"Hey, quick question: should we do [X] or [Y] first? My thinking is [X] because [reason]. What do you think?"

**Feature scope:**
"I was thinking about [feature]. Is that easy or hard to build? Should we cut it from MVP or keep it?"

**Timeline check:**
"How's progress on [feature]? On track for end of month? Need anything from me?"

**Decision needed:**
"I need your input on [decision]. Tech implications? What would you recommend?"

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### DO:

- ✅ Keep communication async-friendly (he's busy)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Micromanage technical choices
- ❌ Change scope mid-sprint

- ❌ Overpromise to beta users
- ❌ Tell Oikotie yet (wait until you have traction)
