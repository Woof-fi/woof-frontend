# Woof - Answers to Your Key Questions

Based on our conversation, here are clear answers to your most important questions.

---

## 1. Equity Split - What's Fair? 💰

### The Short Answer: **50/50 is standard and recommended** ✅

### Why 50/50 Works:

**Arguments FOR 50/50:**
- ✅ **You're both equally critical** - Without developer, no product. Without you, no vision/direction.
- ✅ **Standard for co-founders** - Most successful startups start 50/50 between founder + technical co-founder
- ✅ **Keeps it simple** - No resentment about "who gets more"
- ✅ **Equal skin in the game** - Both motivated equally
- ✅ **You're best friends** - Don't let equity ruin friendship

**Arguments AGAINST giving yourself more (60/40):**
- ❌ Ideas are worth very little without execution
- ❌ Developer does the hardest work initially (building everything)
- ❌ You meet daily and trust each other - no need to nickel and dime
- ❌ Could create resentment: "I'm doing all the coding but getting less?"

### What About "I Had the Idea"?

**Hard truth:** Ideas are worth almost nothing. Execution is everything.

- Facebook wasn't the first social network (MySpace, Friendster existed)
- Google wasn't the first search engine (Yahoo, Alta Vista existed)
- Woof won't be the first pet app

**What matters:**
- Your PM skills (product, strategy, fundraising, go-to-market)
- His development skills (building the entire product)
- Your combined execution

Both are equally critical. 50/50.

### What About Money?

**If costs are split 50/50 → 50/50 equity** ✅

**If you pay more (say 70/30):**
- Option A: Still do 50/50 (it's €5K max, don't overcomplicate)
- Option B: Track it as a loan to the company (you get paid back later)
- Option C: Slight adjustment (52/48, 55/45) but keep it close

**My recommendation:**
- **If it's under €5K-€10K in early costs: You pay, keep 50/50 equity**
- Reason: Simplicity, goodwill, you can afford it
- Treat it as your "sweat equity" contribution while he codes

**If it's more than €10K:**
- Track as convertible note or loan
- Company pays you back when funded

### What About Your Wife as UX Designer?

**40/30/30 (You/Dev/Wife) is RISKY:**

❌ **Cons:**
- She's "out of the game too long" (your words)
- Three-way splits are harder to manage
- What if she doesn't contribute much? Hard to take equity back
- What if you divorce? (Sorry, but it's a business consideration)

✅ **Better approach:**
- Start 50/50 (you + dev)
- Hire wife as contractor if needed (pay per project)
- OR give her small equity (5-10%) if she contributes significantly
- OR give her equity FROM YOUR share (you do 45/50, give her 5)

**My recommendation:**
- **50/50** between you and developer
- Hire wife as needed, pay consulting fees
- If she becomes critical, give her equity later (from a pool)

### Standard Startup Equity Practices:

**Co-founder splits:**
- 50/50 (most common for 2 co-founders)
- 60/40 (if one is clearly CEO and other is "joining" their company)
- 65/35 (if one had traction before the other joined)

**For Woof:**
- You have a prototype, but need him to build the real thing
- You're equal partners starting together
- → **50/50** ✅

### Vesting is Critical!

**Whatever split you choose, ADD VESTING:**

**Standard vesting:**
- 4-year vesting schedule
- 1-year cliff
- 25% after year 1, then monthly

**What this means:**
- If someone leaves in 6 months → gets 0%
- If someone leaves in 1 year → gets 25%
- If someone leaves in 2 years → gets 50%
- 4 years = fully vested

**Why it matters:**
- Protects both of you if someone quits early
- Industry standard for investors (they'll require it anyway)

### My Recommendation for Woof:

**Equity Split:**
```
Tommi:     50%  (4-year vesting, 1-year cliff)
Developer: 50%  (4-year vesting, 1-year cliff)
```

**Early costs (€100-€5K):**
- Tommi pays (you can afford it)
- Keep 50/50 equity (simplicity)

**If costs exceed €10K:**
- Track as loan to company
- Company repays when funded
- Still keep 50/50 equity

**Wife:**
- Not in initial equity split
- Hire as contractor if needed
- Can grant equity later if she's crucial (from reserved pool)

## 2. What is NIY? (Business Finland Grant) 🇫🇮

### TL;DR: **FREE MONEY! 💰**

**NIY** = "Nuorten Innovatiivisten Yritysten" (Young Innovative Companies)

### What It Is:

A **GRANT** (not a loan!) from Business Finland for startups.

**Amount:** €30,000 - €75,000
**Repayment:** ZERO (it's a grant, you keep it!)
**Equity taken:** ZERO
**Strings attached:** Must use it for the approved project

**This is literally free money for building your startup.** 🎉

### Requirements:

✅ **Company:**
- Registered Finnish Oy (Ltd company)
- Less than 6 years old
- Less than 50 employees
- Independent (not owned by big corp)

✅ **Project:**
- Innovative product or service (Woof qualifies!)
- Growth/international potential (Nordics expansion counts!)
- Development project (building the app counts!)

✅ **Team:**
- Competent team (PM + top developer = excellent!)
- At least one person working significantly on it

✅ **Financials:**
- Own financing: €5K-€15K (you must co-invest)
- Budget for the project
- 3-year financial projections

✅ **Innovation:**
- New or significantly improved product
- Woof qualifies: dog-centric social + health diary + meetups = innovative!

### How Much Can You Get?

**Grant covers:** 50-75% of approved project costs
**You cover:** 25-50%

**Example:**
- Total project cost: €100,000
- NIY grant: €50,000 - €75,000 (50-75%)
- Your investment: €25,000 - €50,000 (25-50%)

**Typical first-time applicants get:** €30K-€50K

### What Can You Use It For?

✅ **Allowed:**
- Salaries (your salary + developer salary)
- Subcontractors (designers, developers)
- Infrastructure (AWS, servers, tools)
- Marketing and user acquisition
- Travel for business development

## 3. Domain Name Alternatives 🌐

Since **woof.fi** is taken (and €50 bid unlikely to win), here are great alternatives:

### Option 1: Try Other Finnish Domains

**woof.com** - Check availability (unlikely available)
**mywoof.fi** - "My Woof" - personal feel
**woofapp.fi** - Clearly an app
**woofsocial.fi** - Descriptive
**woofbook.fi** - Like "Woof Book"
**koirawoof.fi** - "Koira" = Dog in Finnish

### Option 2: Get Creative with Finnish

**hau.fi** - "Hau" = "Woof" in Finnish! (Short, memorable!)
**hauhau.fi** - "Hau Hau" = Dog bark sound in Finnish
**pentuwoof.fi** - "Pentu" = Puppy
**koirabook.fi** - Dog book
**koirakaverit.fi** - Dog friends

### Option 3: Global Domains

**getwoof.com** - "Get Woof" - modern, startup-y
**woofapp.com** - Clear it's an app
**woofhq.com** - Woof HQ
**woofworld.com** - Global feel
**mywoof.com** - Personal
**wooflife.com** - Lifestyle
**woofclub.com** - Community feel
**woofbook.com** - Social network feel

### Option 4: Fun Alternatives

**pawsome.fi** - Pun on "awesome"
**dogbook.fi** - Straightforward
**packapp.fi** - "Pack" = dog group
**tailwag.fi** - Cute!
**barkbook.fi** - Social network for dogs

### Option 5: Modern .app Domains

**woof.app** - Clean, modern TLD
**mywoof.app** - Personal
**getwoof.app** - Action-oriented

### My Top Recommendations:

**Tier 1 (Best):**
1. **hau.fi** - SHORT (3 letters!), Finnish word for "woof", memorable
2. **getwoof.com** - Modern, startup feel, global
3. **woof.app** - Clean, clearly an app

**Tier 2 (Great backups):**
4. **woofapp.com** - Descriptive, clear
5. **mywoof.fi** - Personal, Finnish
6. **hauhau.fi** - Fun, Finnish

### How to Check Availability:

**Finnish domains (.fi):**
- https://www.fi-domain.fi/
- Search and register directly

**International (.com, .app):**
- Namecheap.com
- Google Domains
- GoDaddy

**Cost:**
- .fi domains: ~€20/year
- .com domains: ~€10-15/year
- .app domains: ~€15/year

### My Recommendation:

**Try to get: hau.fi** 🏆

**Why:**
- Super short (3 letters) - VERY rare!
- Finnish word = local connection
- Memorable and fun
- Probably available (less obvious than woof.fi)
- Can brand as "Hau - Woof for Dogs" in Finnish market
- Works as "Hau" globally too (short domains are gold)

**Backup: getwoof.com or woof.app**

## 4. What to Build First? (MVP Priority) 🎯

You raised a great question:

> "I'm not sure what will become core functionality. Is it the social media side, the play dates part, the adding dog friends part, or the dog diary or a mix of all of these?"

### The Honest Answer: **We don't know yet - and that's OK!**

### What We DO Know:

The **prototype shows all these features matter:**
- Social feed
- Dog friends
- Health diary
- Meetups/playdates

**They work together** - it's hard to remove one without weakening the others.

### Two Approaches:

### Approach A: Build Everything (Broad MVP) 🏗️

**What:** All features from revised MVP scope
- Social feed + posts
- Dog friends
- Health diary
- Meetup coordination
- Dog parks

**Pros:**
- ✅ Shows complete vision
- ✅ Can test what people actually use
- ✅ More impressive for funding
- ✅ Addresses multiple pain points

**Cons:**
- ❌ Takes longer (3-4 months)
- ❌ More complex to build
- ❌ Harder to get initial traction (too much at once?)

### Approach B: Pick One Core, Add Others Later (Focused MVP) 🎯

**What:** Start with ONE primary feature, add others incrementally

**Option B1: Health Diary First**
- Week 1-6: Health diary perfected
- Week 7-8: Add basic profile + friends
- Week 9-10: Add simple feed
- Week 11-12: Add meetups

**Option B2: Social Feed First**
- Week 1-6: Social feed + posts perfected
- Week 7-8: Add dog friends
- Week 9-10: Add health diary
- Week 11-12: Add meetups

**Option B3: Dog Parks/Meetups First**
- Week 1-6: Park discovery + meetup scheduling perfected
- Week 7-8: Add profiles and friends
- Week 9-10: Add feed
- Week 11-12: Add health diary

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster to launch something (6 weeks)
- ✅ Get user feedback early
- ✅ Iterate based on what users love
- ✅ Less overwhelming for users

**Cons:**
- ❌ Might feel incomplete
- ❌ Users might not understand full vision
- ❌ Harder to apply for NIY (less impressive)

### My Recommendation for Woof: **Approach A (Broad MVP)** ✅

**Why:**
1. **You're applying for NIY grant** - need to show complete vision
2. **Features complement each other** - hard to separate
3. **3 months is acceptable** - both working 20 hrs/week = doable
4. **You have a top developer** - he can handle complexity
5. **No rush** - side hustle, no pressure to launch in 6 weeks

### BUT: Prioritize WITHIN the Broad MVP

**Phase 1 (Month 1): Foundation**
- Auth (Google, Apple, email)
- Dog profiles (create, edit, view)
- Photo uploads
- Basic navigation

**Phase 2 (Month 2): Core Social + Health**
- Social feed + posts + likes + comments
- Dog friends (add, accept, list)
- Health diary (vet visits, vaccinations)
- Timeline view

**Phase 3 (Month 3): Meetups + Polish**
- Dog park discovery (OpenStreetMap)
- Meetup creation + RSVP
- Reminders (health + meetup)
- UI polish, bug fixes

**Beta Launch: End of Month 3**
- All features working
- 50-100 beta users
- See what they use most
- Iterate based on feedback

### THEN Learn What's Core:

After beta launch, track:
- Which features do users use daily?
- Which features do users love (NPS, feedback)?
- Which features drive retention?

**Examples:**
- If users obsess over health diary → lean into that
- If users love social feed → lean into that
- If meetups drive engagement → lean into that

**You'll discover the "core" through usage data, not guessing!**

### Summary:

**Build:** Broad MVP with all features (3 months)
**Launch:** Beta with everything
**Learn:** See what users love
**Double down:** On the features that work

This way you test your complete vision without guessing what to cut.

## 5. User Validation - Without Formal Interviews 🕵️

You said:

> "I'm a little bit worried about giving information about the service at this point, but maybe we can be very discreet in the interviews too?"

### I totally understand stealth mode concerns!

### Lightweight Validation Approach:

Instead of formal interviews, do **casual conversations**:

### Option 1: Casual "Problem Discovery" Chats ☕

**Don't mention Woof at all!** Just ask about problems:

**Questions to ask dog owner friends:**
1. "How do you keep track of your dog's vet visits and vaccinations?"
2. "Do you ever forget when the next vaccination is due?"
3. "How do you find other dogs for playdates?"
4. "Would you like to connect with other dog owners in your area?"
5. "Do you use any apps for your dog? Which ones?"

**You're not revealing your idea, just validating pain points exist.**

### Option 2: "Idea Validation" (Vague) 💡

If you trust them:

**Script:**
"Hey, I'm thinking about a social app for dog owners. Would that interest you?"

**If yes:**
"What would make you actually use it versus just download and forget?"

**Don't reveal:**
- Specifics of features
- Timeline
- That you're building it now

### Option 3: Show Prototype (Only to Trusted Friends) 👀

If they're very trusted and would never steal the idea:

**Script:**
"I've been playing around with a concept. Can I show you? Just curious if you'd use something like this."

**Show them the prototype (woof.zip)**

**Ask:**
- "What do you think?"
- "Would you use this?"
- "What features matter most?"
- "What's missing?"

### Option 4: Skip Interviews Entirely (For Now) 🚫

**Honestly? You probably don't need formal interviews yet.**

**Why:**
- You already got positive feedback from dog owners
- Your developer is committed
- You're building it anyway
- You can validate post-beta launch with real users

**Better approach:**
- Build MVP (3 months)
- Launch beta to trusted friends/family
- THEN get feedback on the actual product
- Iterate based on real usage

### My Recommendation:

**Skip formal interviews now.** Here's why:

1. **You have enough validation** (dog owners said it's great)
2. **Stealth concerns are valid** (ideas can be copied)
3. **Better to validate with real product** (not concepts)
4. **You're building it anyway** (developer committed)
5. **NIY doesn't require user interviews** (business plan is enough)

**Instead:**
- Build MVP
- Beta launch to 50-100 trusted dog owners
- Get feedback on actual product
- That's your validation

**For NIY application:**
- Mention you talked to dog owners informally
- Positive feedback on concept
- Market research on existing competitors (koirapuisto app, etc.)
- That's sufficient for grant

## 6. What Should You Work On? (While Developer Codes) 💼
